### Recommendation 

Building a job recommendation engine involves a number of steps. We would want to utilize the available data - Linkedin profiles, job applications, and survey responses - to build a comprehensive understanding of both the user's preferences and job characteristics. Here is a high-level approach:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: The first step is to clean and preprocess the data. This would involve handling missing data, dealing with inconsistencies, converting categorical variables into a suitable numerical form, and possibly normalizing certain numerical features.

2. Feature Engineering: Generate meaningful features from the Linkedin profiles, job applications, and survey responses. This could include experience level, skills, education level, past job titles, industries worked in, location preferences, salary preferences, job type (full-time, part-time, contract), company size preferences, etc.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This step involves understanding the data, finding patterns, and gaining insights which can be used for building our recommendation system.

4. Building a User Profile: Using the collected data, build a profile for each user. This should include not just the hard facts about their work history and skills, but also inferred preferences based on their job applications and survey responses.

5. Building a Job Profile: Similarly, build a profile for each job. This could include required skills, experience level, location, salary, company size, industry, etc.

6. Building a Recommendation Model: There are several possible approaches here:

- Collaborative Filtering: This method would use the behavior of similar users to recommend jobs. If user A and user B applied to many of the same jobs, and user A applies to a new job, that job could be recommended to user B.
  Content-Based Filtering: This approach would recommend jobs similar to those the user has applied to in the past, based on the job profiles.
- Hybrid Model: A combination of collaborative and content-based filtering often provides the best results.
  Deep Learning Models: More complex models like neural networks can be used to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between different features.

7. Evaluation: This would involve splitting the data into a training set and a test set, training the recommendation model on the training set, and then evaluating its performance on the test set. Performance can be evaluated based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or ROC AUC, depending on what is most important for the application.

8. Model Optimization: Based on the results of the evaluation, the model might need to be optimized. This could involve tuning hyperparameters, selecting different sets of features, or trying entirely different modeling approaches.

9. Implementation: Once the model is ready, it can be used to generate job recommendations for users. The results can be displayed in a feed and updated regularly as new data comes in.

10. Continuous Learning and Feedback Loop: Continuously collect feedback from users about the quality of recommendations and use it to improve the model. This can be implicit feedback (such as whether users click on recommended jobs) or explicit feedback (such as asking users to rate recommendations).

Remember, building a recommendation system is an iterative process. It's important to continuously evaluate and refine the system based on user feedback and performance metrics. This will help ensure that the system remains effective and useful over time.

### Bidding KeyWords

Creating a model to bid on a new unseen keyword based on historical keyword bid data requires a bit of creativity because keywords themselves are non-numeric and the connection between them isn't clear-cut. Here's a high-level overview of an approach you could take:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to remove any errors, outliers or missing values. For keyword data, you might want to normalize the text by converting all characters to lowercase and removing any extraneous characters (e.g., punctuation).

2. Feature Engineering: With text data like keywords, a common approach is to transform the text into numerical features. Several ways to do this include:

- Bag of Words (BoW): This represents the occurrence of words within the text data, without considering the order of the words.

- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): This measures the importance of a keyword within a collection or corpus. It takes into account not just the frequency of a word but also how often it appears across all documents (keywords in this case).

- Word Embeddings: This is a more advanced method that represents words in a high-dimensional space where the semantic similarity between words is captured (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

- BERT Embeddings: You can use a pre-trained BERT model to convert each keyword into a more sophisticated embedding that captures both the semantics and the context of the keyword.

- Self-Supervised Learning: This approach allows you to learn a representation from the keyword by predicting a part of it given the rest. This auxiliary task forces the model to capture meaningful semantics of the keywords.

3. Model Training: Once you've transformed the keywords into numerical features, you can then train a regression model using these features as the input and the bid price as the target. You could start with simpler models like linear regression, but could also explore more complex models like random forest regression, gradient boosting regression, or even deep learning regression models.The features can serve as the input to your model, and the bid prices can be your target. Depending on the complexity of the relationship between your features and target, you could use linear models, ensemble models, or even neural networks.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics. For regression problems, this could be mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared. Split your data into a training set and a validation set (and possibly a separate test set) to properly evaluate your model's performance and avoid overfitting.It's important to consider the trade-off between model complexity, performance, and computational efficiency when selecting a final model.

5. Keyword Prediction: To bid on a new, unseen keyword, you would first need to convert it into the appropriate numerical features (using the same method you used for the training data). You could then input these features into your trained model to predict an appropriate bid price. Apply the same preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline to new, unseen keywords, and feed the resulting features into your trained model to predict their bid prices.

It's worth mentioning that this approach assumes that there's some connection between the text of the keyword and the bid price. If the bid price is mostly determined by factors not captured in the keyword text (e.g., competitiveness of the keyword, time of day, etc.), this approach might not be very effective. In such a case, you might need additional data to build a more accurate model.
